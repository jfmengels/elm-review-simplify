## [2.0.22] - 2022-11-03

Fixed an issue where `0 - f x` would be simplified to `-f x` instead of `-(f x)` [#52]

## [2.0.21] - 2022-09-06

Fixed an issue in where let declarations would not be fused when there was only a single element in the first let declaration.

## [2.0.20] - 2022-09-06

The rule now simplifies:
1. Applying record access simplification over if and case expressions.
```elm
(if condition then
   { record | a = 1 }
 else
   { record | field = 2 }
).field
-->
 if condition then
   { record | a = 1 }.field
 else
   { record | field = 2 }.field
```
when all patterns can later be simplified. In this example the final result will be
```elm
if condition then
  record.field
else
  2
```

This also applies to case expressions when all branches can be simplified. Thanks [@miniBill]! [#40]

2. Simplify case expressions that can be simplified to let variables [#48]

```elm
a =
  case value of
    { x, y } ->
      1
-->
a =
  let
    { x, y } =
      value
  in
  1
```

3. Merging multiple let declarations

```elm
let
    a = 1
in
let
    b = 1
in
a + b
-->
let
    a = 1
    b = 1
in
a + b
```

## [2.0.19] - 2022-08-29

The rule now DOESN'T (it did before) simplify case of expressions where all the branches have the same code when one of
the patterns references a custom type from your project. For example
```elm
case x of
  A -> 1
  B -> 1
  C -> 1
```
does not get simplified to `1` like before. But the simplification still happens if the patterns only reference custom
types that come from dependencies or `elm/core`, like
```elm
case x of
  Just _ -> 1
  Nothing -> 1
--> 1
```

The reasoning is that often you want the compiler to give you a reminder when you introduce a new custom type, which this
simplification made very hard. It also sometimes created some worse code when you pattern matched on a custom type with
only a single constructor.

The configuration setting `Simplify.ignoreCaseOfForTypes` now only takes custom types from dependencies. Any type
provided to this function that is not found in the dependencies will now trigger a global error.
It is likely that you won't need this function anymore. If you do, please open an issue because I'd love to know. 

A number of `elm-review` users didn't use `Simplify` because of the simplification above, so I'm hoping that this change will make
you able to use the rule again.

The rule now simplifies:
- `{ a = 1, b = 2 }.a` to `1`. Thanks [@miniBill]! [#35]
- `{ foo | b = 1 }.a` to `foo.a`. Thanks [@miniBill]! [#37]
- `if a == "a" then if a == "b" then 1 else 2 else 3` to `if a == "a" then 2 else 3`

## [2.0.18] - 2022-08-14

Improves the error message for some simplifications.

## [2.0.17] - 2022-08-14

#### Removal of unreachable `if` branches [#31]

`Simplify` now has the ability to infer values from if conditions, which it will use to simplify boolean expressions and even to remove some `if` branches.
```elm
if a && b then
  if a then -- we know this must be true
    1
  else -- so we can remove this else
    2
else
  3
```

It should also be able to catch things like

```elm
if x == 1 then
  if x == 2 then -- we know this must be false
    ...
```

Note that this will (purposefully) only simplify boolean expressions by what has been inferred from conditions. Therefore,
the following will not be simplified. The reasoning behind the decision is that you would not be able to write code like
below, which can be useful if you want to rely on top-level constants that you may wish to change at a later point in time.

```elm
enableDevMode = False

value =
    if enableDevMode then
```


#### Simplifications

The rule now simplifies:
- `(a < b) == (b > a)` to `True`
- `(a <= b) == (b >= a)` to `True`
- `(a && b) == (b && a)` to `True`
- `(a || b) == (b || a)` to `True`
- `Dict.member x Dict.empty` to `False`

## [2.0.16] - 2022-07-16

The rule now simplifies:
- `.field a == a.b` to `True`
- `a |> fn == fn a` to `True`
- `fn <| a == fn <| a` to `True`


## [2.0.15] - 2022-05-05

The rule now simplifies:
- `List.member x []` to `False`
- `Set.member x Set.empty` to `False`
- `List.intersperse x []` to `[]`


## [2.0.14] - 2022-04-22

The rule now simplifies:
- `List.indexedMap f []` to `[]`
- `List.indexedMap (\_ value -> f value) list` to `List.map (\value -> f value) list`
- `List.indexedMap (always f) list` to `List.map f list`


## [2.0.13] - 2022-04-21

The rule now simplifies:
- `Maybe.andThen (\b -> let y = 1 in Just y) maybe` to `Maybe.map (\b -> let y = 1 in y) maybe`
- `Result.andThen (\b -> let y = 1 in Ok y) result` to `Result.map (\b -> let y = 1 in y) result`


## [2.0.12] - 2022-04-09

The rule now simplifies:
- `List.concatMap (\a -> [ b ]) list` to `List.map (\a -> b) list` 
- `Maybe.andThen (\a -> if condition a then Just b else Just c) maybe` to `Maybe.map (\a -> if condition a then b else c) maybe`
- `List.filterMap (\a -> if condition a then Just b else Just c) maybe` to `List.map (\a -> if condition a then b else c) maybe`
